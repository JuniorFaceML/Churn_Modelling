# Churn_Modelling

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to conduct an analysis and build a classification model to identify employees who have left the company. An analysis was performed, and I believe it is challenging to find any stable dependencies, as personal factors or a poor atmosphere in the workplace can influence an employee's decision to leave. Overall, based on the available data, robust models were built with the best metrics, and the results were comparable to the work of other respondents on Kaggle.
